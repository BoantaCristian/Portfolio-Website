### Portfolio Website - Boanta Cristian
 
Developed from scratch, intuitive, minimalist and responsive for many devices (Desktop, Tablet, Phone, etc.), on different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Mozilla, etc.) and with various resolutions (HD, FHD, WQHD, 2k, 4k, etc.), based on common screen sizes and aspect ratio.

  * The creation process
  * Making website responsive, not only for any resolution (common brakepoints), but also handling differences of approach and interpretation in various browsers of the css
  * Solving issues and errors using the vast internet
  
- Improvements
  * Find a way to render contend dynamicaly based on a calculation, not on manually adjust: 
   * `.styleclass{ attribute: calc(%/px/vw/rem/... + px)}`
  * Use database instead of JSON for site information, but right now, for the existing amount of information, I consider is not needed
  * Find a good alternative for blur filter in browsers that don't support `backdrop-filter`
  * Implement skill level bar animation for mobile devices, because hover action dosen't actually exist on mobile
